# Musical Spelling

Repository built to support the theory in my undergraduate thesis on musical pitch spelling.

## Roadmap

* Complete database implementation of musical score hierarchy
* Implement score-reader to convert from score format (such as [musicXML](https://www.musicxml.com/)) to database format
* Implement bridge to pull score(s) data from database into solver
